<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I love all the characters and can relate to them.</p>
<h3>Five Feet Apart</h3>
<p>Such a nice emotional love story. It amazes me to see how much two people can love each other
    and be distant at the same time.</p>
<h3>Animal</h3>
<p>Really a cool movie. Love the dope characters</p>
